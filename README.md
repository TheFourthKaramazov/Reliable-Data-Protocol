# Reliable Data Transfer Protocol
## The reliable data transfer protocol (RDP) is based on RFC-908 and is inteded as a reliable but lightweight protocol to transfer data for packet based application suitable for bulk transfer. For more infromation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc908

# Note:
## Not yet complete. Once completed it still remains to see if the protocol will be useful for it's inteded purpose: bulk transfer of RAW image data between OBC and and inference board of a cubesat. If the protocol is viable, then the project will be converted to C/C++.
